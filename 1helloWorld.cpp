// This is a basic C++ program. 
// The `//` symbol is used for adding comments in the code. Comments are helpful for other developers to understand the code better. The compiler ignores any line that is commented out. 

// To run this code in the terminal window of the VSCode editor, you need to execute two commands:
// 1. `g++ -o code filename.cpp` - This command compiles the code, and if it executes successfully, it will generate an executable file.
// 2. `./code.exe` - This command runs the compiled executable.
